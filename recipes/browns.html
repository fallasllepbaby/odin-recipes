    <h3>Good, old-fashioned, restaurant-style hash browns. Perfect with hot pepper sauce and ketchup!</h3>
    <p>This hash browns recipe fries shredded potato in clarified butter for diner-style hash browns that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.</p>
    <p>If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too â€” especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. Stir until water is cloudy; drain and cover potatoes again with fresh cold water. Stir again to dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry with paper towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Heat clarified butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded potatoes into hot butter in an even layer; season with cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip or stir and continue to cook until potatoes are browned and crusty all over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
