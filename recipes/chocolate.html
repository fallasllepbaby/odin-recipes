    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup crushed pretzels</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped pecans</li>
        <li>1 (11 ounce) package caramel bits (such as Kraft®)</li>
        <li>1 (3.4 ounce) package apple chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 2 cups of chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and melt in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between, until smooth and consistent.

</li>
        <li>Line a 13x18 baking sheet with parchment. Spread the chocolate onto the baking sheet in a thin, even layer. Allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Melt caramel bits in another microwave-safe bowls in 30-second intervals, stirring between, until the caramel bubbles. Quickly drizzle caramel on top of the chocolate, then use a spatula to swirl it evenly around the pan. While the caramel is still warm, top with pretzels, pecans, and apple chips until fully covered. Use another large sheet of parchment paper to gently press the toppings into the caramel. Move to the fridge to chill for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining ½ cup of chocolate chips in the microwave. Transfer to a zip-top bag, cut off a small corner, then drizzle the chocolate evenly over the whole tray.</li>
        <li>Move to the fridge to set completely, 2 to 3 hours. Cut in squares or break into large pieces to serve.</li>
    </ol>
